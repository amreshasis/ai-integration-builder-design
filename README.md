## 1. AI Integration Builder – Figma Design

This repository showcases a complete UI/UX design for an Integration Builder platform.
The project demonstrates how users can create integrations for SaaS applications simply by providing the relevant API documentation.

The end-to-end flow includes selecting an application, uploading API documentation, generating integration code, testing it safely in a sandbox environment, and promoting it to production.

## 2. Figma Design

I’ve published the full UI/UX design for the AI-Generated Integration Builder.
You can view all the screens, flows, and components directly through the link below:

Key design frames include:

Dashboard

Application Selection (Calendly, Dropbox, etc.)

API Documentation Upload

Code Generation Workspace

Sandbox Testing

API Response Viewer

Deployment Confirmation

Settings & Safety Controls

## 3. *Design Priorities*

The design focuses on creating a clean, simple, and intuitive product experience that enables anyone—not just engineers—to build integrations.

Core areas of focus:

Turning API documentation into ready-to-use integration code

Encouraging a sandbox-first workflow to avoid production issues

Automatically assembling technical elements such as:

API client structure

Authentication setup

User & usage data retrieval

Pagination handling

Logging

Error handling

Ensuring accessibility for both technical and non-technical users


## 4. *Safety & Reliability Features*

Since the platform allows users to create and execute integration logic, several safeguards were designed into the flow:

Mandatory sandbox execution before any production deployment

API key validation checks

Sensitive information masked by default

Read-only mode for initial runs

Rate-limit and quota warnings

Clear, structured error messages with suggested fixes

## 5. *Tools I Used*

Designed in Figma, using structured layouts, reusable components, and a consistent design system.

## 6. *Support*
